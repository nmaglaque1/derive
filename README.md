# Dérive

Visit 5 websites. For each one, document or comment on the following:
* What is the URL?
* How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?
* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
* What parts of the site are interactive?
* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?
* What is one thing you would change about this site?

Your responses may be point form, or 1–2 paragraphs about each site as long as you cover the points listed above for each.

## Site 1
* https://geoguessr.com/
* Google searched "interesting websites"
* The design looks current. It is responsive (tried and tested). There's a hover effect. Rounder edges.
* The navigaton is easy to use. It is very simple that there seems to be less content in the navigation system.
* The buttons are interactive, clicking it will lead you to the game.
* The site is interesting to look at first. It is kinda challenging to play the game especially when you're not much of an outdoorsy person or doesn't know much about geography and stuff.
* The ad is kinda annoying, you have to wait 5 seconds on every round before you get to know the result of your answer to the question. So removing this would be nice.
