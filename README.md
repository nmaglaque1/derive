* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
* What parts of the site are interactive?
* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

## Site 1
![geoguessr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46494501/51444373-a9d53200-1cc4-11e9-80bb-88b63c81acb1.png)
* https://geoguessr.com/
* Google searched "interesting websites"
* The design looks current. It is responsive (tried and tested). There's a hover effect. Rounder edges.
* The navigaton is easy to use. It is very simple that there seems to be less content in the navigation system.
* The buttons are interactive, clicking it will lead you to the game.
* The site is interesting to look at first. It is kinda challenging to play the game especially when you're not much of an outdoorsy person or doesn't know much about geography and stuff.
* The ad is kinda annoying, you have to wait 5 seconds on every round before you get to know the result of your answer to the question. So removing this would be nice.

## Site 2

* https://asoftmurmur.com/
* Google searched "interesting websites"
* The desifgn is ok. It is responsive. There's a background image.
* The navigation is quite simple. But I've encountered a problem that when you click on that "Blog" then click on "Get Updates", a "404 Not Found" page pops out.
* The buttons are interactive. You also get to change the volume or sound level by sliding the buttons left - right.
* The site is good. You get to mix different sounds (but not much option) and choose the volume level. I think this suits people who can think or work in an environnment with subtle or moderate sounds. Or they tend to work best with noise around them, but not that distractive.
* I would not change anything i guess but additional sounds would be great like soft instrumental music or any sound that can still be considered pleasing and relaxing.

## Site 3
* http://wishboxstudio.in/social-impact-graphic-design/
* Fisrt thing that popped out when i opened Safari is this previous site that I researched for my other class.
* The website is fine. It is also responsive. Design is current and trendy. Some parts of it are asymmetrical which is quite interesting to look at.
* The navigation system is quite awesome. Unique hamburger menu.
* Buttons are interactive (hover effect). There's also simple animation when hovering the mouse over images. At the very bottom, there is a contact section wherein you can leave a meesage to them using your email plus the captcha for verification purposes.
* The site is great! Beautiful design and interesting contents. There are also cool interactive parts in it that I'd like to learn.
* I don't see any parts of it that needs to change. It's alright.
